1. I still continue to keep an eye on [Nhost CLI's repository](https://github.com/nhost/cli). I continue to open issues, and submit pull requests to fix existing ones.

1. I built, and still maintain, this [HTTP tunnels library](https://github.com/mrinalwahal/tunnels) to expose local environments to public internet for those users who don't have a static IP.

1. Worked with International Neuro-informatics Cordination Facility (INCF), Germany Node. Project details are [available here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6619076489641984).
