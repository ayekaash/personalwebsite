## Complaints of Atheists

To be fair to atheists, I do not wish to paint them all under the same brush. Most of the ones that I've met in my life are fairly well intentioned and civil people who are simply fighting against dogmatism, superstition and partuclarly that pseudo-science which renders harm onto innocents.

And I wholeheartedly support this endevour of theirs. As a student of science, I completely endorse any movements that aims to erradicate dogmatism and superstitious ideas from our socities.

<alert>

But surely the atheist movements seem very concerned with trying to "civilize the ignorants, by us (atheists) the ones with monopoly over wisdom."

</alert>

Therefore, let us unambigously mention the complaints that atheists have.

1. It is downright stupid to believe any funny ideas about how the universe works from scriptures and holy books.
1. Religion is dogmatic and prevents people from thinking outside the box. (to answer this question, use ramanujan's example)

And those are the ideas and movements that we tend to challenge in this piece.

## what atheists can't do?

- Can't build functional alternatives
- can't convince a religious person about the actual value/essence in being in outcast, and not belonging to the pack
- might themselves be religious; explain communism
- demean religious people for their beliefs
- don't understand that people are allowed to believe in funny ideas about how the universe works, similar to how quantum physicists believe in teleportation.
- why the word "rationality" must not be used to demean religious belifes
- Religions might create problems, but they act as antivirus for most of the society.

<list :item="tldr"> </list>

When I was young, I equated atheism with rationality and proudly questioned every religious ritual as stupidity and ingnorance on part of those who indulge in it. Like every other proud atheist, I used to laugh at the funny ideas about how the universe works mentioned in random scriptures and holy books.

Since the moment my mind began to grasp the essence of computational philosophy, why and how human societies behave and organize the way they do, began to make sense more thoroughly.

Yes! It wasn't a deep dive into psychology or sociology that englightened me, rather it was taking a completely computational view of the universe. The same principles of the turing machine that run your computers, is precisely what opened my mind to human behaviour.

As I grew older I realised that atheists and theists are, more often than not, simply talking past each other. I've since maintained that atheists are merely confused as to why theists and theism exist even in a free country.

## Religion in Free Vs Non-Free Country

Ahan! It is imperative to draw the distinction between why would someone follow a religion in a free country versus a non-free one.

If you are living a country with a de-facto religious State, for example an Islamic or Communist State, then you, for most part, don't really get enough mental and physical freedom to opt-out of your regular religious environment.

Needless to mention some of these countries, like United Kingdom, might have a State religion but may anyway go on to give phenomenal freedom to their residents to opt-out of religious institutions or environment. But those are exceptions. For the sake of this piece, we'll consider hard-line religious States to make the distinction more clear.

## How religious States protect the cult

## Why follow religion?

In my understanding, experience and wisdom, the fundamental reason why someone who declare themselves as active members of a religious community is more straightward and reasonable than complex. 

<alert>

Mind you, announcing your religion when someone inquires you about it is very different from actually believing all the funny ideas about how the universe works written inside scriptures.

</alert>

They do not care about inteiguing, or rather "funny," ideas about their god given purpose in life, or how the universe was created, instead they mostly equate regularly following certain traditions and daily rituals as being "religious." This is where I figure is the fundamental mismatch or lack or coherence is between what atheists believe religious people believe, versus the perception or thoughts that these people possess.

For the sake of scientific skepticism let's question, "why believe in traiditions and rituals as well?" I'll come to answer this later. #insert anchor tag to future areas#

In fact, this is precisely how I think most people are behaving as active members of society when they call themselves "religious". Take the example of India. I am quite certain that most Hindus do not get to bed every night thinking about the model of Turiyam from Mandukya Upanishad. Most Hindus don't even know what that is. They haven't read the Upanishads or most of their scriptures. Nor do they plan to. Neither do most Muslims think about the nothingness in the unviverse before the big bang in their daily lives.


I think Atheists simply do not get this and 

## Feeling of belonging

Let's assume we are hit with a once in a lifetime pandemic, which we recently were. And we have these "priests" ordained by reputed and prestigious insitutions like AIIMS, or Standford Med in the United States. These, so called, priests may not necessarily be the fines brains, but as long as they are care I'm not an epidemiologist or a doctor. So, it's a subconscious decision on my part to simply side with these priests **until** I find a more sophisticated functional alternative. And this is where their **belief** in the capability, or excellence, or these priests comes from. Aligning with *someone who seems to know the answer* is better than accepting fate and defeat. Surely, the poets and intellectuals can go on to argue that the latter is more desirable but that is not what a poverty stricken person faced with a deadly pandemic is *privileged* enough to choose. And for most problems that people turn to the gods and godessess are equally, if not more, **deadly**.

<alert>

And a *functional alternative* is one of the things that Atheists can't provide for religious humans.

## Where Atheists Fail

Atheists are incompetent when it comes to actually convincing theists about the essence or any tangible value in becoming outcasts. Or betraying their packs. This becomes especially challenging when in case of some religious groups, even attempts at becoming outcasts can bring severe punishments. Or purely in terms of religious theories come with severe risks including eternal damnation, social ostracism, etc. 

All well intenioned atheists must understand that sticking with the pack and siding with the *priests* is a perfectly reasonable and rational stance to take. At least, subconsciously. the unnatural move would be to become an outlier. But why? Remember, the terminal goal of human life is **to stay alive**. And who says that? My computational view of the universe. I'll explain more about this in upcoming piece that I'm writing.

**Therefore, a more reasonable and non-violent way to slowly and steadily take dogmatic religion away from society is to carefully build functional alternatives to every illegitimate practice that you believe theists engage in.**

Let's take a quick example for this.

In India, there is a prevalent practice wherein right before a couple gets married their parents try to get their horoscopes matches. The actual practice is termed "janam kundli milwana."

Numerous times when they don't match, the superstitious parents are known to force their kids into all kinds of gimmicks and dogmatic rituals to try and get their horoscopes "corrected."

Therefore, given how complicated it becomes for parents to *arrange* the *correct match* for their child, they often submit to such superstitious practices.

But since a few years, a seemingly simple *functional alternative* as emerged to find faster matches based on numerous parameters, including horoscopes. That is **matrimonial sites**.

Given how ridiculously easy and convenient it became for both the parents and their children to find faster matches without compromising on their beliefs, the prevelance of engaging in dogmatic, and often harmful, rituals to "ward off the bad omen" has also gone down drastically.

<alert>

Functional alternatives makes cultures evolve. And cultures are important.

</alert>

A lot of atheists are now sadly turning anti-culture. I admit that not all cultures are equal, but the alternative is to make backward cultures evolve. And this can definitely not be achieved by demeaning or gaslighting people into submission or existential crisis.

## Nature of relationship w/ religions

    - Religions can be intriguing and arouse curious.
    - Religious people can use religions for science too. Example - Ramanujan
    - western vs eastern schools of philosophy

## relationships w/ gods

- hardcore gods who give orders
    - can be rude and strict to achieve his societal goals
    - strong views of morality of individuals

- spiritual idea of a god
    - benevolent and loving
    - always sides w/ you
    - represents the conscious universe

## Religious Texts

how must one read the religious texts? keeping in mind these leaders were fairly reasonable for their time, and how they managed to convince a fairly unreasonable audience to become their followers
