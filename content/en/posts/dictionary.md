1. Mathematics - religion of references.
1. Computation - religion of implementation.
1. Intelligence - ability of the mind to create models using given information.
1. Smartness - ability of using mental models to achieve your goals.
1. Wisdom - ability of choosing the right goals.
1. Consciousness - simulation of contents inside our attention.
1. God - self that spans multiple minds.
1. Culture - shared principles decided upon consensus (or principled negotiation amongst agents of society) to efficiently achieve shared terminal goals.
1. Attention - Ability to focus on a certain location.
1. Context - cache storage where you store all the contents you were paying attention to. (This is in turn used to create models. Because some things in our life only make sense in the long term. A temporary storage of certain objects is required to only run a simulation on them.)
