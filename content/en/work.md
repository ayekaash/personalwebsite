3+ years of professional experience. Been coding since I was 14. What got me into this world was a fascination with Borland C++ blue coloured screen.

## Nhost.io, Stockholm

- Second core team member.
- Designed and maintained the Nhost CLI from scratch. The source code is open-source and [available here](https://github.com/nhost/cli). This repository can be used to judge my Golang skills.
- Contributed to all of Nhost stack, in the early stages, including front-end SDKs, authentication and storage.
- Wrote an experimental Golang library for exposing local environment using HTTP tunnels to the public internet to increase testing time, and serve as an alternative to preview environments.
- Handled design, development, testing, documentation and deployment of the CLI.

From May 2021 to February 2022, I worked with [Nhost](https://nhost.io/), as a backend engineer. Was one of the core team members after Nhost raised $3 Million from the founders of GitHub and Vercel.

### Learnings

I learned a great deal from [Johan](https://twitter.com/elitasson/) and [Nuno](https://twitter.com/nunopato) about how to set up an early-stage engineering team. Everything from carefully handpicking engineers, to prioritizing which features make sense to be rolled out next, to finding workarounds from troubling yet insignificant engineering problems, and finally building a great product, whilst placing a lot of focus on user feedback. Apart from how much I loved writing code and solving engineering problems, I have a special respect for both of them.
