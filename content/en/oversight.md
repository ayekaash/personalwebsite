When we were in college, me and my friend [Hemant](https://instagram.com/hemanttvats) wanted to build a
self-driving/autonomous military tank. One that can drive to the target location by itself, neutralize/engage the targets, and drive back to the base by itself. While trying to fetch research grants for building the first prototype, we realised the monumental lackadaisical problems driven by attidude and ego in India's academic research ecosystem. Nobody would give us funds because we were *too young*. We were told **we didn't even have a PhD**. As if that was mandatory for building advanced tech.

We both envisioned that we would go on to build an in-house research incubator, on the lines of India's DRDO, which would work on all latest technologies, including deep learning and quantum computation. We were young and green at that time, so we were naive enough to start such a journey.

## Business Plan

We started small by trying to connect mentors inside colleges, who were mostly professors, experienced in writing research papers, with mentees, like students, who were looking for guidance and mentorship on how to write their own research papers, and how to get them published.

After running these operations manually, over Google Docs and spreadsheets, we started building a platform, which would go on to be hosted at <code>Oversight.in</code>.

We (it was mostly my own idea) took a bet that we will build a crowdfunding platform where young researchers would publish their research projects/ideas, and a target amount for the funds they need to either execute their idea or to take it to completion.

<blockquote>

And a small portion of those sponsorships would go to us as **platform fees**. Enough to generate a stable revenue for us.

</blockquote>

I was inspired by <a href="https://experiment.com">Experiment.com</a> which was serving identical audience, but in the United States. And no such platform was available for Indian students.

## Journey Begins

I hired a team of interns to start coding the platform. Because I'd never ventured into web development, and didn't even want to, and most of my experience was in writing neural networks. I was paying their stipends with the money I'd earned while doing open source work for Google. But soon I realised that there's only so well interns can do. The platform we wanted designed actually required the skills of at least Software Development Expert Level 3 (SDE-III). And these were mostly just 2nd year interns in a random private engineering college in India.

After spending months trying to baby sit them about nitty-grities like minor UI/UX changes, and insignificant bug fixes, I was starting to give up on them. Besides the platform looked nowhere what I wanted design. Wasn't even professional. We weren't even sure if it was safe enough to handle payments.

I finally fired the team of interns, and started to learn web development myself. [Hasura](https://hasura.io) immediately caught my eye with how easy it made working with database schemas, automatically handling migrations, and giving a straightforward GraphQL inetrface using which I could perform queries and mutations on the database directly from the frontend. This was my first time encountering GraphQL. I'd only rarely even worked with REST before this.

Then I began my journey into Golang. I always wanted to learn it. Had heard a lot about this phenomenal language at that time. Besides, I could only write in Python until then.

And my search for a first-class easy to use front-end framework landed me on [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org). And I immediately fell in love with how easy Nuxt makes it to develop and deploy a straightforward front-end.

And that is it. It took me about 2 months to learn all these new tools, and put together a beta version of the platform that could be rolled out for first batch of users. This is just a few months before the pandemic.
